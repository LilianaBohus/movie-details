## Improvements I could add
- Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- Javadoc - altough I do believe good code is self-documenting (I made some minor comments where necessary)
- switch to FeignClient for HTTP calls instead of RestTemplate
- error/exception handling could be more polished!
- rate limiting for API calls
- using Lombok (I wasn't sure if the team uses it:))
- DTO naming is not the cleanest right now, ~~I am very tired, no brainzzzZZzz~~
- could have done more and seperable commits but it was a speedrun and I don't feel comfortable pushing non-working code, so I just squashed them
- and probably many more
